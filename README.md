Work on your Angular skills by completing challenges and building an app.

##Description##

This is a project that contains unfinished Angular app called Trivia Generator, an app that generates trivia questions and answers. Your goal, once you choose to go along with this exercise, is to complete all challenges and build the rest of the functional requirements. And don't you skip on them unit tests either, because they matter as well :).
